# Changelog

All notable changes to thornotes are documented here.

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server at `POST /mcp` — exposes notes as resources and tools for AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- API token authentication — bearer tokens with `tn_` prefix, managed per-user from the account page
- Account page modal — create/revoke API tokens, view MCP endpoint URL and connection snippet
- `api_tokens` DB table — stores tokens with `name`, `last_used_at` (async background update), and per-user scoping
- MCP tools: `search_notes`, `get_note`, `list_notes`, `create_note`, `update_note`, `list_folders`
- MCP resources: notes exposed as `note://{id}` URIs with `text/markdown` MIME type
- `BearerMiddleware` in `internal/auth` — validates `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, loads user into request context
- One-time token reveal UI — full token shown only on creation, masked thereafter
- Dark mode support for account modal

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Missing `GET /api/v1/notes/root` route registration caused 404 on initial load
- Root (unsorted) notes not shown after login — `loadFolderTree` now fetches root notes in parallel with folders
- EasyMDE editor crash (`null.insertBefore`) when textarea was not attached to DOM before initialization
- Share page rendered blank content — `html/template` double-escaped note content in `<script>` context; now embedded via hidden `<pre>` element read with `textContent`
- EasyMDE toolbar icons invisible due to CDN font-awesome blocked by CSP — self-hosted font-awesome 4.7.0, added `font-src 'self'` to CSP header

### Added
- `web/static/css/font-awesome.min.css` and `web/static/fonts/` — self-hosted font-awesome 4.7.0 for CSP compliance
- `internal/security/headers_test.go` — unit tests for `SecureHeaders` middleware covering all response headers
- Initial `VERSION` file
